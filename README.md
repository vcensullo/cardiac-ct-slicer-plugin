A plugin specifically designed for 4D Cardiac CT imaging analysis, This modular plugin providing cardiologists and radiologists with tools
for cardiac function evaluation, with analitical additional analytical modules in future updates.
In this version the plugin consists mainly of two modules:

Volume Analysis

Measures right and left ventricular volumes through chamber segmentation, calculates ejection fraction, and generates temporal volume curves for functional assessment.

3D Wall Motion Evaluation Module

which analyzes myocardial wall motion in three dimensions identifying wall motion abnormalities through motion tracking and visualization.
This modular plugin provides cardiologists and radiologists with tools for cardiac function evaluation, with capacity for additional analytical modules in future updates.
